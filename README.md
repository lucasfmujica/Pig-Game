# Pig Game

The "Pig Game" is a classic dice game where the first player to reach 100 points on the board wins. This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to fully implement this game in a web browser.

## How to Play

1. A player rolls the dice as many times as they want. Each result gets added to their round score.
2. But, if the player rolls a 1, all their round score gets lost, and it's the next player's turn.
3. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their round score gets added to their global score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
4. The first player to reach 100 points on the global score wins the game.
